This is a React Native App coded on an IOS device that will allow you to count your rows while knitting or crocheting, it's colorful and interactive,
knitting is a hobby I love to do and so wanted to make a mobile app about something I enjoy.

I want to eventually add functionalities to make knitting charts and chat with other people who enjoy fiber arts.
